      <description>There is no greater measure of success in the NBA than performance in the playoffs. For the biggest names in the sport, whether their resumes include an NBA championship is sometimes a referendum on their careers. Michael Jordan and Bill Russell finish atop many greatest players of all-time lists because of their postseason achievements. Conversely, guys like Karl Malone and Charles Barkley are knocked down some rankings because they never won a ring.</description>

      <description>Background NBA players come from all across the United States, but some areas of the country have greater reputations as centers of basketball activity than others. Which American cities have produced the most NBA players and has this changed throughout the NBAâ€™s history? Are basketball hotbeds from the 1960s still producing the same number of players today or has the game shifted geographically? We will try to answer these questions.</description>

      <description>Background Heading into the NBA draft, the is a general consensus on the rough order that the current crop of prospects should be selected. This can be seen through the numerous draft boards for a given year available on many websites, created by both professional and amateur draft prognosticators. Analysts project who they think will have the best NBA careers using a combination of their own scouting abilities, some group think, and, for the more well-connected individuals, whatever information they may have gathered from league insiders or team executives.</description>

      <description>Background We follow up the previous post on NBA awards voting with a closer look at the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award. MVP is voted on by a panel of about 100 to 130 media members (a different group depending on the year) after the end of the regular NBA season. Voters rank 5 players on their ballots in preferential order with 1st place receiving 10 points, 2nd place 7 points, 3rd place 5 points, 4th place 3 points, and 5th place 1 point.</description>

      <title>NBA Awards Voting - Hometown Bias</title>

      <description>Background The end of season awards for the NBA are voted upon by a panel of media members that include national writers, national broadcasters/announcers, studio analysts, and team beat writers. Up until the 2016-17 season, this group also included team employed broadcasters. NBA fans who have spent enough time watching games on League Pass may have noticed why this was an issue, with hometown biases among many local announcers evident during the call of games.</description>

      <title>NBA Draft - Best/Worst Picks by Team and General Manager</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4303/post/2018/10/10/nba-draft-best-worst-picks-by-team-and-general-manager/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:4303/post/2018/10/10/nba-draft-best-worst-picks-by-team-and-general-manager/</guid>
      <description>Background In recent years, the Sacramento Kings used top 10 draft picks on Thomas Robinson, Ben McLemore, and Jimmer Freddette (I would have included Georgios Papagiannis, but he went 13th). The San Antonio Spurs, on the other hand, were able to get Kawhi Leonard at 15, Tony Parker at 28, and Manu Ginobili at 57. Is all of this luck or are there certain teams or front offices that are more skilled at drafting than others?</description>
