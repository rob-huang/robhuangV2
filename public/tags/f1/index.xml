      <description>Formula One is an international racing series with Grand Prix held across the globe. The race calendar has expanded and moved around throughout the years, with a previously European-heavy lineup now being supplemented with more Middle Eastern/Asian and American events. Races generally start off in the afternoon, but there are locations that now feature night races. How many races fans get to easily experience live depends on where they live.</description>
