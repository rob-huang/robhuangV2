      <description>Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn in Sabrina (1954), Cary Grant and Grace Kelly in To Catch a Thief (1955), and more recently, Daniel Day Lewis and Vicky Krieps in Phantom Thread (2017). What is immediately noticeable when watching those films (at least for this viewer) is the huge age difference between the male leads and their on-screen romantic partners. Humphrey Bogart is nearly 30 years older than Audrey Hepburn. Cary Grant and Daniel Day Lewis are each about 25 years older than Grace Kelly and Vicky Krieps, respectively.</description>
